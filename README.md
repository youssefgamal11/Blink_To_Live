Idea : 

Communication is often a challenge for paralyzed patients, whose families and caregivers struggle to understand their feelings and needs.Since they can only communicate through their eyes, we are planning to blink to live.This application is based on a language developed specifically for helping these people, and patients whose their minds are alert ,In this language, each movement (or group of movements) of eyes represents a specific word or sentence such as (yes, no, I'm fine, I'm in danger) and many other basic words and sentences that the patient needs to understand.The application does not require additional tools - it will only rely on the camera of a mobile device.
